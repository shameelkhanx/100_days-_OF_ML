# 📊 Analysis of AI Tool Usage by Students in India

This project explores how college students across India are using AI tools like **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, and others in their academic lives.

## 🔍 About the Project

With the rise of generative AI, many students have started integrating tools like ChatGPT and Gemini into their study workflows. But how are they actually using them? What devices do they use? Are they willing to pay for access? And does AI usage really help improve academic performance?

In this notebook, I’ve performed a simple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to:

- Understand tool preferences among students
- Analyze device and internet accessibility
- Explore willingness to pay for AI tools
- Check the perceived impact of AI on academic performance

The dataset used is focused on Indian students and their experiences with AI tools in education.

## 📁 Files

- `ai_usage.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with all visualizations and analysis
- `Students.csv`: The dataset used for this analysis

## ✅ Goals

- Spot meaningful patterns and trends in AI tool usage
- Make the analysis visually engaging and easy to interpret
- Share insights that might help researchers, educators, or AI product teams
